# Project : Build a Tribute Page

First of the two projects of basic front end developpement project section.

The goal was to build a tribute page with the following user stories :
- `A tribute page with an image and text can be seen.`
- `Include a link to an external website with further information on the topic.`

I decide to write on Usain Bolt and build something different.

__Particularities :__
* You can see jamaican colors made with a gradient.

* Used a bootstrap well as a container.
* Site is responsive.
